Many organizations file hundreds or thousands of patent applications every year, and keeping track of the competition can be a headache. There is therefore a pressing need to rapidly summarize the subject-matters in a portfolio of patent applications so that portfolios of different companies can be compared, or the evolution of a company's portfolio can be tracked.

But assimilating a set of patent applications manually is time-consuming and possibly even error-prone, so automation is of the essence. This article describes an approach that uses data science techniques to produce visual maps that succinctly capture the subject-matters in a portfolio. These visual subject-matter maps can be used to rapidly identify similarities and differences between competing or evolving portfolios of patent applications.
